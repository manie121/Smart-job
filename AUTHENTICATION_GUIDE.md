# SmartJob Recruiter Dashboard - Authentication Guide

## Enhanced Security Features

The SmartJob Recruiter Dashboard now includes a robust authentication system with the following security features:

### üîê **Secure Registration**

#### **Strong Password Requirements:**

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (@$!%\*?&)

#### **Real-time Password Strength Indicator:**

- **Weak** (Red): Basic password that doesn't meet requirements
- **Medium** (Orange): Partially meets requirements
- **Strong** (Green): Meets all security requirements

#### **Registration Validation:**

- Email format validation
- Duplicate email prevention
- Required field validation
- Terms and conditions acceptance

### üîë **Secure Login**

#### **User Authentication:**

- Only registered users can login
- Email and password verification
- Secure password hashing (simulated)
- Session management with localStorage

#### **Error Handling:**

- Clear error messages for unregistered users
- Invalid credentials feedback
- Input validation with helpful messages

### üß™ **Demo Account for Testing**

A demo account is automatically created for testing purposes:

```
Email: manisha.sah@email.com
Password: Demo@123
```

### üìã **How to Test the Authentication System**

#### **Test 1: Register a New User**

1. Go to the registration page
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Try a weak password - observe the strength indicator
4. Use a strong password (e.g., "MyStrong@Pass123")
5. Accept terms and conditions
6. Successfully register and get redirected to dashboard

#### **Test 2: Login with Invalid Credentials**

1. Go to login page
2. Try logging in with an unregistered email
3. Observe error: "No account found with this email address"
4. Try logging in with wrong password for an existing account
5. Observe error: "Invalid password. Please check your credentials"

#### **Test 3: Login with Valid Credentials**

1. Use the demo account credentials provided
2. Successfully login and access dashboard
3. Or use credentials from a newly registered account

#### **Test 4: Password Strength Validation**

1. Go to registration page
2. Try different password combinations:
   - "weak" ‚Üí Weak (Red)
   - "Medium1" ‚Üí Medium (Orange)
   - "StrongPass@123" ‚Üí Strong (Green)

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### **Features Implemented:**

- ‚úÖ User registration with validation
- ‚úÖ Secure password hashing simulation
- ‚úÖ Email format validation
- ‚úÖ Strong password requirements
- ‚úÖ Real-time password strength checking
- ‚úÖ Login authentication against registered users
- ‚úÖ Proper error messaging
- ‚úÖ Session management
- ‚úÖ Protected routes

#### **Data Storage:**

- Registered users stored in `localStorage` under `smartjob_registered_users`
- Current session stored in `localStorage` under `smartjob_user`
- Passwords are hashed before storage (simulated hashing)

#### **Security Measures:**

- Password hashing (basic simulation)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Session timeout handling
- Clear error messages without exposing system details

### üöÄ **Next Steps for Production**

For a production environment, consider:

1. **Backend API Integration**

   - Replace localStorage with secure backend API
   - Implement JWT tokens for session management
   - Use proper password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)

2. **Enhanced Security**

   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Password reset functionality

3. **Database Integration**

   - Replace localStorage with database storage
   - Implement proper user management
   - Add email verification

4. **Additional Features**
   - Remember me functionality
   - Social login integration
   - Account recovery options

**Note:** This implementation uses localStorage for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, always use secure backend APIs with proper encryption and security measures.
